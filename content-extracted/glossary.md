## Timeframes

### Higher Timeframe (HTF)
Larger timeframes (4H, Daily, Weekly) that show institutional positioning and major support/resistance levels. Smart money operates on these levels.

**Example:** Daily and 4H charts show where major liquidity pools sit.

---

### Lower Timeframe (LTF)
Smaller timeframes (5m, 15m, 1H) used for precise entry timing after HTF context is established.

**Example:** Use 5m chart to find exact entry after Daily sweep is confirmed.

---

### Macro Time
Specific timing windows (2-5 AM, 8-11 AM, 1-3 PM EST) where institutional algorithms execute. Session models based on these.

**Example:** 2-5 AM = London open manipulation, 9:30-12 = NYC reversal.

---

## Zones

### Buy Side Liquidity (BSL)
Stop losses and buy orders sitting above recent highs. Smart money sweeps these levels before reversing down.

**Example:** Price breaks above swing high to grab stops, then reverses sharply.

---

### Sell Side Liquidity (SSL)
Stop losses and sell orders sitting below recent lows. Smart money sweeps these levels before reversing up.

**Example:** Price breaks below swing low to grab stops, then reverses sharply.

---

### Change in State of Delivery (CISD)
The exact zone where market structure changed from bearish to bullish (or vice versa). Your entry level.

**Example:** Mark the order block where price broke structure after sweep.

---

### Order Block (OB)
The last opposing candle before a strong move. Shows where institutions placed orders. Acts as support/resistance.

**Example:** Last down candle before rally = bullish order block for entries.

---

### Fair Value Gap (FVG)
Imbalance in price action showing 3 candles where candle 2 doesn't touch candles 1 and 3. Price often returns to fill these gaps.

**Example:** Gap between highs/lows of 3 consecutive candles = unfilled FVG.

---

### Inverse Fair Value Gap (iFVG)
FVG that's been partially filled but still acts as support/resistance. Often used for entries within CISD zones.

**Example:** Previously filled FVG now acting as entry zone after sweep.

---

### Premium Zone
Upper half of HTF range (above 50% equilibrium). Institutional sellers dominate. Look for short setups here.

**Example:** Price in top 25% of Daily range = premium, expect shorts.

---

### Discount Zone
Lower half of HTF range (below 50% equilibrium). Institutional buyers dominate. Look for long setups here.

**Example:** Price in bottom 25% of Daily range = discount, expect longs.

---

### Equilibrium (EQ)
50% midpoint of a range. No directional bias. Avoid trading at equilibrium—wait for premium or discount.

**Example:** Price at 50% of Daily range = neutral, wait for clear zone.

---

### HTF Interval Labels
Timestamp labels displayed on HTF candles showing timeframe and exact time in America/New_York timezone. Helps identify specific candle opens/closes for session timing.

**Example:** Label reads '4H 09:30' = 4-hour candle opened at 9:30 AM EST.

---

### Divider Hierarchy
Auto-scaled line styling based on timeframe importance. Short-term (≤1H) = dotted, Intraday (4-8H) = dashed, Daily = solid gray, Weekly+ = solid orange.

**Example:** Solid orange line = Weekly open/close, Dotted line = 15m candle boundary.

---

## Patterns

### Liquidity Sweep
When price briefly breaks a key level (BSL/SSL) with a wick to grab stops, then immediately reverses. This is your trigger.

**Example:** Candle wicks through high, closes back inside range = bullish sweep.

---

### Change of Character (C2)
3-candle reversal pattern confirming a liquidity sweep held. Shows market structure shifted direction.

**Example:** After sweep: large reversal candle + follow-through = confirmed C2.

---

### C3 Expansion
The continuation candle after C2. Confirms momentum in new direction. Often targets opposite liquidity.

**Example:** Strong expansion candle after C2 reversal moving toward target.

---

### Smart Money Technique (SMT)
Divergence between correlated assets (ES/NQ, EUR/GBP) revealing institutional manipulation. Increases setup probability.

**Example:** ES makes new high but NQ doesn't = bearish SMT divergence.

---

### Market Structure Shift (MSS)
When price breaks previous structure (breaks high in uptrend or low in downtrend), confirming trend change.

**Example:** Price makes lower low then breaks previous lower high = MSS up.

---

### Double Purge (⟐)
When both BSL and SSL liquidity levels are swept and rejected on the same HTF candle, creating a high-probability reversal setup. The ⟐ symbol indicates count of double purges detected.

**Example:** Price sweeps high, reverses to sweep low, then reverses again = ⟐ double purge.

---

### Real-Time Sweep Detection
Live monitoring that identifies liquidity sweeps as they occur, not just on candle close. Updates sweep status intrabar for immediate awareness of potential reversals.

**Example:** Price wicks through SSL mid-candle, 'Live' detection flags potential sweep immediately.

---

## Execution

### Silver Bullet Hour
9:30-10:30 AM EST and 3-4 PM EST. High-probability reversal windows where institutional sweeps occur most.

**Example:** Watch for sweeps during 9:30-10:30 AM window for best setups.

---

### One Shot One Kill (OSOK)
Execute once per setup. No averaging down, no second chances. Either it works immediately or you exit.

**Example:** Enter at CISD, if no reaction in 2-3 candles = exit cleanly.

---

### SMR Entry (✓)
Sweep, Mitigate, Reverse confirmed entry. When a liquidity sweep is followed by mitigation of the CISD zone and price reverses in the expected direction. The ✓ symbol tracks confirmed SMR entries.

**Example:** SSL swept → price returns to OB → reverses up = ✓ SMR entry confirmed.

---

### H1 Setup Phase
First session window (2-6 AM EST) where range establishes and liquidity pools form. Not for trading, for observation only.

**Example:** 2-6 AM: Price ranges between 4480-4500, establishing BSL/SSL levels.

---

### H2 Reversal Phase
Second session window (6-10 AM EST or 9:30 AM-12 PM EST) where liquidity sweeps occur and reversals trigger. Highest probability entry window.

**Example:** 9:45 AM: SSL swept at 4480, C2 reversal = enter long in H2 window.

---

### H3 Continuation Phase
Third session window (10 AM-2 PM EST) where momentum follows through after H2 reversal. Take partial profits at 1:3 RR.

**Example:** 11 AM-1 PM: Price continues up from 4485 entry, hitting 4515 target.

---

### H4 Delivery Phase
Fourth session window (2-6 PM EST) where final push into target occurs. Close remaining positions at 1:4-1:6 RR.

**Example:** 3 PM: Price reaches opposite liquidity at 4525, exit final 50%.

---

## Concepts

### Distribution
Smart money selling into retail buying. Happens at premium levels. Precedes bearish moves.

**Example:** Price ranges at highs while volume increases = distribution phase.

---

### Accumulation
Smart money buying into retail selling. Happens at discount levels. Precedes bullish moves.

**Example:** Price ranges at lows while volume increases = accumulation phase.
