## Pre-Trade Checklist

☐ **HTF bias established?**
Check Daily/4H - are we in premium (short) or discount (long)?

☐ **Key levels marked?**
BSL/SSL levels, previous high/low, order blocks identified

☐ **Right session timing?**
H2 window (9:30-12 PM EST) or macro time active?

☐ **Liquidity sweep confirmed?**
Wick through BSL/SSL + body closes back inside range?

☐ **C2 pattern present?**
3-candle reversal structure confirming sweep held?

☐ **CISD zone identified?**
Where did structure break? Order block or iFVG marked?

☐ **SMT divergence? (Optional)**
Check ES vs NQ - divergence present for extra confluence?

☐ **Risk/Reward acceptable?**
Minimum 1:3 RR to opposite HTF liquidity?

## Entry & Exit Rules

**1. OSOK Principle**
One Shot One Kill - single entry per setup, no averaging down

**2. Stop Placement**
Just beyond the sweep level (BSL/SSL that was taken)

**3. Entry Trigger**
Price taps CISD zone + shows rejection wick

**4. Target Setting**
H3 = 1:3 RR (take 50%), H4 = 1:4-1:6 RR (runner)

**5. Breakeven Move**
Move stop to entry at 1:1 risk/reward achieved

**6. Max Wait Time**
If no reaction at CISD within 2-3 candles → exit

## Session Timing Quick Ref

### H1 Setup
**2-6 AM EST**
Range builds, liquidity forms - mark levels, don't trade yet

### H2 Reversal
**9:30 AM-12 PM EST**
Silver Bullet - MAIN TRADING WINDOW, sweeps occur here

### H3 Continuation
**12-3 PM EST**
Momentum follow-through, take partials at 1:3

### H4 Delivery
**3-6 PM EST**
Final push to target, runner positions

## Common Mistakes & Fixes

❌ **Trading at equilibrium**
✓ Wait for premium or discount - avoid 40-60% range

❌ **No sweep confirmation**
✓ Never enter without clear BSL/SSL sweep + C2

❌ **Wrong session timing**
✓ Focus on H2 window, avoid dead hours

❌ **Ignoring HTF bias**
✓ Always check HTF first - context is king

❌ **Averaging down losses**
✓ OSOK only - if wrong, exit cleanly

❌ **Moving stop loss wider**
✓ Never widen stop - accept loss and move on

❌ **Taking partials too early**
✓ Let it reach proper targets (H3/H4)

❌ **Overtrading setups**
✓ Quality over quantity - wait for A+ setups only

## Risk Management Rules

**Position Size**
1-2% risk per trade maximum

**Daily Loss Limit**
3% of account - stop trading if hit

**Win Rate Target**
45-55% with 1:3+ RR = profitable

**Max Open Trades**
1-2 concurrent positions only

**Streak Management**
After 3 losses, reduce size by 50%

**Profit Taking**
50% at H3 (1:3), runner to H4 (1:4-1:6)
