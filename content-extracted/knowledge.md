## The Fractal Foundation

# The Core Principle

**The market cannot reverse from a swing point.**

Therefore, successful expansion must involve trading away from confirmed swing points. The Mecha-X Approach profiles a Higher Time Frame (HTF) candle with a Lower Time Frame (LTF) swing using the fractal model—the best 4-hour Power of Three strategy available.

### HTF Setup & Key Levels

Before entering any trade, establish precise HTF structure using OHLC levels on higher timeframes (Daily/4H).

**Mechanically Defined Levels:**

**BSL/SSL (Liquidity):** Confirmed swing highs (BSL) and swing lows (SSL) using ICT Pivot Detection (3-candle formation). These levels are tracked for sweeping—the engineered liquidity that must be manipulated to initiate a reversal.

**Equilibrium (EQ):** The midline of a candle's range. For Reversal Sequence patterns (C2), EQ is calculated based on the Wick Range Only if a reversal pattern is detected. Used to validate expansion days (respecting EQ) versus opposing runs (disrespecting EQ).

### Golden Rule:
If price is in premium → look for shorts. If in discount → look for longs. No trade in the middle (equilibrium).

## Sequence 1 of 3: Mecha-X Reversal Sequence (C2 Pattern)

**The Swing Confirmation**

### What Is It?
This sequence confirms the low or high of a new 4H expansion candle by validating that the necessary LTF swing has formed. Since the HTF candle is not opening within a prior LTF swing, its low/high must be created from one.

### Why It Matters
This action confirms the formation of the small wick that supports expansion—the precise reversal tick at the HTF extreme.

### Mechanical Confirmation (C2)
Two mechanical actions relative to the previous candle (C1):
1. The subsequent candle (C2) must execute a sweep of C1's BSL or SSL (liquidity extreme)
2. C2 must then close back inside the body range of C1

### C2 Formation Types

**C2-REV (Reversal):** Swept and closed back inside the range, but not near the opposite extreme.

**C2-SNAP (Strong Reversal):** Swept and immediately rejected to the opposite extreme of the C1 range.

**C2-EXP (Continuation):** C2 body engulfs the entire C1 range and closes beyond, indicating expansion.

### Golden Rule:
Once the LTF swing is confirmed → trade AWAY from the swing point.

## Sequence 2 of 3: Mecha-X Continuation Sequence

**Immediate Follow-Through Expected**

### What Is It?
This sequence confirms that immediate follow-through is expected because the LTF reversal structure was finalized in the prior period.

### Why It Matters
The new HTF candle opens within a lower time frame swing that the previous candle created. No new reversal structure is needed immediately.

### How To Apply
- Identify that current candle opened within prior LTF swing
- Expect the candle to simply open and expand/continue
- No C2 pattern confirmation required
- Trade with the established swing direction

### Golden Rule:
Opening within a swing = continuation bias. Trade with the flow.

## Sequence 3 of 3: Mecha-X Aligned Sequence (C3 Tracking)

**Re-Entry & Realignment After Retracement**

### What Is It?
This sequence facilitates re-entry and continuation if price executes an internal retracement while expanding.

### Why It Matters
A retracement means price action is not aligned anymore. To resume HTF expansion, a swing formation (reversal candle) is necessary to realign price with the expansionary narrative and cap off that retracement.

### C3 Zone Mechanics
- System tracks the C3 Continuation Zone following a confirmed C2 setup
- Zone is mechanically bounded by C3 open price and calculated C2 Equilibrium level
- HTF-AWARE break detection monitors whether price closes beyond zone boundary (plus buffer)
- If zone holds and realignment occurs → continuation expected

### How To Apply
- Wait for C2 pattern confirmation first
- Monitor C3 zone boundaries automatically
- Enter when price retests and holds the C3 zone
- Trade resumption of HTF expansion

### Golden Rule:
C3 zone hold + realignment = continuation signal. Failed hold = invalidation.

## CISD: Change in State of Delivery

**Momentum Confirmation & Target Projection**

### What Is It?
CISD detects strong momentum immediately following a reversal swing and provides mechanical target zones.

### Mechanical Detection
- Identifies two or more consecutive momentum candles following the swing
- Defines the CISD level (the order block or zone where momentum initiated)
- Projects mechanical Targets: 1x, 2x, 2.5x, 3.5x, 4x based on momentum range

### Retest Tracking
- System tracks retests of the CISD zone
- Marks if zone is broken after a retest (potential failure signal)
- Valid CISD retest = high-probability continuation entry

### Golden Rule:
Enter at CISD zone retest. Targets are mechanical. Stop loss just beyond the swing.

## Session Timing Integration

**When to Watch: H1-H4 Model**

Not all hours are equal. The 4H/1H profiling model tells you WHEN reversals and expansions happen.

### Session Windows
- **H1 (Setup)**: 2-6 AM EST — Range builds, liquidity forms
- **H2 (Reversal)**: 6-10 AM EST — Silver Bullet window, sweeps occur
- **H3 (Continuation)**: 10 AM-2 PM EST — Momentum follows through
- **H4 (Delivery)**: 2-6 PM EST — Final push into target

### Golden Rule:
Focus on H2 window (2-6 AM or 9:30-12 PM). This is where sweeps happen and C2 patterns trigger.

## Trade Execution: OSOK (One Shot One Kill)

**Precision Entry & Management**

### What Is It?
OSOK means one entry per setup. No averaging, no hoping. Either it works immediately or you're wrong.

### Execution Rules
- Enter at CISD zone when price taps and rejects
- Move stop to breakeven at 1:1 risk/reward
- Take 50% profits at H3 (1:3 RR)
- Let remaining position run to H4+ (1:4-1:6 RR)

### Invalidation
- If price doesn't react at CISD within 2-3 candles → exit
- If sweep gets "Max Breaks" exceeded → permanent invalidation
- Body close beyond swept level = invalidation

### Golden Rule:
Trust your mechanical setup or exit cleanly. No second chances on same setup.

## Final Section

# Now You Understand the System

Every piece connects. HTF levels → C2 Reversal Sequence → Continuation Sequence → C3 Aligned Sequence → CISD Entry → Execute. Nothing is random. Nothing is disconnected.

This is fractal price profiling—mechanical, repeatable, logical.
