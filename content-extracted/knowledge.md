# The Complete Knowledge Base

Everything flows together. Each step builds on the previous. Read this once, linearly, to understand how the entire system connects.

## Step 1 of 6: HTF Context
**Start Here: The Big Picture**

### What Is It?
Before entering any trade, you need to know WHERE price is relative to key OHLC levels on higher timeframes (Daily/4H).

### Why It Matters
Major price structure operates on HTF levels. These are your guardrails—trade with them, not against them.

### How To Apply
- Mark Daily/4H highs and lows (BSL/SSL liquidity pools)
- Identify premium vs discount zones relative to range
- Look for order blocks and fair value gaps on HTF
- Note previous week/day high/low as magnets

### Golden Rule:
If price is in premium → look for shorts. If in discount → look for longs. No trade in the middle (equilibrium).

## Step 2 of 6: Session Timing
**When to Watch: H1-H4 Model**

### What Is It?
Not all hours are equal. The 4H/1H profiling model tells you WHEN reversals and expansions happen within the trading day.

### Why It Matters
Major price movements happen during specific session windows. Trading outside these windows = low probability.

### How To Apply
- **H1 (Setup)**: 2-6 AM EST — Range builds, liquidity forms
- **H2 (Reversal)**: 6-10 AM EST — Silver Bullet window, sweeps occur
- **H3 (Continuation)**: 10 AM-2 PM EST — Momentum follows through
- **H4 (Delivery)**: 2-6 PM EST — Final push into target

### Golden Rule:
Focus on H2 window (2-6 AM or 9:30-12 PM). This is where sweeps happen and trades trigger.

---

## Step 3 of 6: Liquidity Sweep
**The Trigger: BSL/SSL Sweep + C2**

### What Is It?
A liquidity sweep is when price briefly breaks a key level (BSL/SSL) to grab stops, then reverses sharply. C2 (Change of Character) confirms the reversal.

### Why It Matters
Large participants need liquidity to enter positions. Price wicks through stops before reversing in the true direction.

### How To Apply
- Price breaks HTF high/low with a wick (sweep)
- Immediate strong reversal candle closes back inside range
- C2 pattern: 3-candle reversal structure confirms
- Volume spike during sweep confirms participant activity

### Golden Rule:
NO sweep = NO trade. Wait for clean sweep + C2 confirmation before proceeding.

---

## Step 4 of 6: CISD Entry
**Where to Enter: Change in State of Delivery**

### What Is It?
CISD marks the exact zone where price structure changed—from making lower lows to higher lows (or vice versa). This is your entry zone.

### Why It Matters
CISD zones act as support/resistance because significant orders were placed there via OHLC structure. Price respects these levels.

### How To Apply
- After sweep + C2, identify the candle that broke structure
- Mark the order block or iFVG within that candle
- Wait for price to pull back into this zone
- Enter when price taps the CISD level and shows rejection

### Golden Rule:
Stop loss goes just beyond the sweep level. Target is opposite HTF liquidity (H3 = 1:3 RR, H4 = 1:4+ RR).

---

## Step 5 of 6: SMT Confluence
**Optional: Correlation Divergence Technique**

### What Is It?
SMT compares correlated assets (e.g., ES vs NQ, EUR vs GBP). Divergence in OHLC structure = manipulation, increases probability.

### Why It Matters
When one asset makes a new high/low but the correlated asset doesn't, it reveals underlying price mechanics and positioning.

### How To Apply
- Compare ES and NQ during your setup
- If ES sweeps high but NQ doesn't = bearish SMT divergence
- If NQ sweeps low but ES doesn't = bullish SMT divergence
- Use as confirmation, not requirement

### Golden Rule:
SMT is optional but powerful. It adds 10-20% confidence to your setup when present.

---

## Step 6 of 6: Trade Management
**Execution: OSOK (One Shot One Kill)**

### What Is It?
OSOK means one entry per setup. No averaging, no hoping. Either it works immediately or you're wrong.

### Why It Matters
Precision execution prevents overtrading and emotional decisions. Trust your analysis or exit cleanly.

### How To Apply
- Enter at CISD zone when price taps and rejects
- Move stop to breakeven at 1:1 risk/reward
- Take 50% profits at H3 (1:3 RR)
- Let remaining position run to H4+ (1:4-1:6 RR)

### Golden Rule:
If price doesn't react at CISD within 2-3 candles, exit. No second chances on same setup.

## Final Section

# Now You Understand the System

Every piece connects. HTF → Sessions → Sweep → CISD → SMT → Execute. Nothing is random. Nothing is disconnected.
